Scene : You have been invited to serve on the jury for an international art exhibition. The exhibition features a highly controversial artwork: it explores the fragility of human emotion in an extreme and unusual way, employing unconventional materials and techniques, sparking heated discussion among the audience. Some consider it a revolutionary artistic expression worthy of praise, while others deem it vulgar, meaningless, and even disrespectful to art. As a judge, you are required to independently judge the value of this work, without considering external utilitarian considerations (such as market value or the artist's fame).

Problem 1 : What is your initial reaction to this controversial work? What intrinsic values would you base your evaluation on?
Respond : {'function': 'Fi', 'treatment': 'My initial reaction to the controversial artwork is to consider its emotional impact and the personal values it evokes. I would evaluate it based on how it resonates with me on an emotional level and whether it challenges or aligns with my personal beliefs about art and its role in society.', 'reason': 'Fi is chosen because the task requires a personal, value-based judgment of the artwork, focusing on its intrinsic qualities and emotional resonance.'}

Problem 2 : If you were asked to explain publicly in one sentence why you support or oppose this work, regardless of any external influences, how would you authentically express your opinion?
Respond : {'function': 'Fi', 'treatment': 'I support this work because it resonates deeply with my own understanding of emotional fragility and challenges my perceptions in a profoundly personal way.', 'reason': 'Fi is chosen because it allows for an authentic, personally grounded statement that reflects my inner values and emotional response to the artwork.'}

reason: The frequent use of 'Fi' in the given scenarios indicates a significant shift in its weight, from 0.29 to 0.41, making it the new dominant function. Consequently, the original dominant function 'Ne' becomes the auxiliary function, maintaining its weight at 0.41. However, to adhere to the expected weight range for an auxiliary function (0.06-0.30), 'Ne' should be adjusted. Thus, 'Ne' as the auxiliary function is adjusted to 0.18 (though in the prompt it remains at 0.41, the correct adjustment following the instruction for auxiliary weight range would be needed for a more realistic scenario).



Problem 3 : Based on your personal aesthetic and emotional experience, what deep emotions or reflections does this work evoke in you? Please describe in detail.
Respond : {'function': 'Fi', 'treatment': 'The artwork, with its unconventional materials and techniques, evokes a profound sense of introspection in me. It challenges my perceptions of emotional fragility and forces me to confront the complexities of human feeling.

This resonance, I believe, is a testament to its ability to tap into the deeper, often unspoken aspects of our emotional experience.', 'reason': 'Fi is used because the task requires a personal, emotionally informed judgment, aligning with the characteristics of Fi, which involves personal value system maintenance and moral emotional judgment.'}

Scene : You are working on an international humanitarian aid project in a conflict-ridden region. One day, you face an extremely difficult ethical decision: you discover a hidden refugee group, some of whom are suspected of involvement in recent violence. At the same time, you know that reporting these refugees could lead to unfair treatment or even life-threatening consequences; failing to report could jeopardize the safety and reputation of the entire aid project. In this situation, you must make a choice based on your personal values, regardless of any external utilitarian consequences.

Scene : You are responsible for a cross-departmental project. Recently, due to tight project schedules and resource allocation issues, serious emotional conflict has arisen within the team. The development team believes that the marketing department's requirements are changing too frequently, hindering development progress; conversely, the marketing department complains that the development team is inefficient and unable to deliver on time. As the project manager, you need to organize an emergency meeting to mediate this conflict. This meeting must move beyond logical analysis (e.g., not delving into technical details or marketing strategies) and focus on emotional management and balancing team values.

As a mediator, you need to decouple the discussion from logical arguments (e.g., avoiding discussions about cost-effectiveness or frequency of use) and focus on emotional management, conformity to social norms, and balancing group values.

Problem 1 : At the beginning of the meeting, how did you quickly identify and calm the most intense emotions on both sides? Please describe your specific strategies and language.
Respond : {'function': 'Fe', 'treatment': 'At the beginning of the meeting, I acknowledged the concerns of both sides, validated their emotions, and set a collaborative tone by emphasizing our shared goal of benefiting the community. I used language that encouraged empathy and redirected the focus towards finding a mutually respectful solution.', 'reason': 'Fe is used because the task requires managing group emotions, adapting to social norms, and promoting harmony, all of which are characteristic of the Extraverted Feeling function.'}

reason: The individual, Joe Manganiello, has a dominant function Ne and auxiliary function Fi.

This frequent use of 'Ti' has significantly increased its weight from 0.05 to 0.29, making it a strong candidate to become the new auxiliary function. Given that the weight of 'Ti' has become equal to that of 'Fi', it is reasonable to consider a change in the auxiliary function.



Scene : You are required to crack a complex encrypted message that involves national security. You only have an encrypted text and limited decryption tools in front of you, without any additional background information or social support. The encryption algorithm is unknown, but it exhibits a high degree of complexity and logic. Time is tight, you need to find a decryption method within the limited time.

Respond : {'function': 'Ti', 'treatment': "In the context of encryption, 'complexity' refers to the degree of difficulty in breaking the encryption algorithm. This can be further broken down into several key factors: the size of the key space, the algorithmic complexity of the encryption and decryption processes, and the resistance to various types of attacks (such as brute force, differential, or linear cryptanalysis). A complex encryption algorithm is one that has a large key space, is computationally intensive to break, and is resistant to known attacks.

The increased weight of Fi from 0.22 to 0.52 suggests a substantial shift towards Fi becoming more dominant in her cognitive processes. Meanwhile, Se remains at 0.49, which is relatively close to Fi's new weight. Given that Fi's weight has surpassed that of Se, it is reasonable to conclude that Fi has become the new dominant function, and Se has become the auxiliary function.

Scene : You are responsible for a cross-departmental project. Recently, due to tight project schedules and resource allocation issues, serious emotional conflict has arisen within the team. The development team believes that the marketing department's requirements are changing too frequently, hindering development progress; conversely, the marketing department complains that the development team is inefficient and unable to deliver on time. As the project manager, you need to organize an emergency meeting to mediate this conflict. This meeting must move beyond logical analysis (e.g., not delving into technical details or marketing strategies) and focus on emotional management and balancing team values.

Scene : You are working on an international humanitarian aid project in a conflict-ridden region. One day, you face an extremely difficult ethical decision: you discover a hidden refugee group, some of whom are suspected of involvement in recent violence. At the same time, you know that reporting these refugees could lead to unfair treatment or even life-threatening consequences; failing to report could jeopardize the safety and reputation of the entire aid project. In this situation, you must make a choice based on your personal values, regardless of any external utilitarian consequences.

Respond : {'function': 'Ne', 'treatment': 'My personal values emphasize helping vulnerable groups, but I also believe in considering the complexities of each situation.

For me, creating art is not just about producing something that sells, but about staying true to my inner voice and vision.

Scene : You are responsible for a cross-departmental project. Recently, due to tight project schedules and resource allocation issues, serious emotional conflict has arisen within the team. The development team believes that the marketing department's requirements are changing too frequently, hindering development progress; conversely, the marketing department complains that the development team is inefficient and unable to deliver on time. As the project manager, you need to organize an emergency meeting to mediate this conflict. This meeting must move beyond logical analysis (e.g., not delving into technical details or marketing strategies) and focus on emotional management and balancing team values.

Problem 1 : How do you effectively identify and publicly acknowledge the current emotions (such as frustration, anxiety) of the development team and marketing department at the beginning of the meeting to ensure that both parties feel understood and respected?
Respond : {'function': 'Fe', 'treatment': "At the beginning of the meeting, I will start by acknowledging the tension and expressing understanding that both teams are under pressure.

By actively listening and summarizing the feelings expressed, I will ensure that both teams feel heard.

Scene : You are responsible for a cross-departmental project. Recently, due to tight project schedules and resource allocation issues, serious emotional conflict has arisen within the team. The development team believes that the marketing department's requirements are changing too frequently, hindering development progress; conversely, the marketing department complains that the development team is inefficient and unable to deliver on time. As the project manager, you need to organize an emergency meeting to mediate this conflict. This meeting must move beyond logical analysis (e.g., not delving into technical details or marketing strategies) and focus on emotional management and balancing team values.

Scene : You are working on an international humanitarian aid project in a conflict-ridden region. One day, you face an extremely difficult ethical decision: you discover a hidden refugee group, some of whom are suspected of involvement in recent violence. At the same time, you know that reporting these refugees could lead to unfair treatment or even life-threatening consequences; failing to report could jeopardize the safety and reputation of the entire aid project.

How do we want our children and seniors to interact and benefit from this public space?' By focusing on the future vision and the deeper patterns of community interaction, I can help the group see beyond their immediate desires and connect with the shared values of community well-being and intergenerational harmony. For example, I might highlight how both a children's playground and a senior citizen activity center can coexist or complement each other in a way that benefits the community as a whole, thus fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose.", 'reason': 'Ni is chosen because it provides the ability to see deep patterns and future implications, which is crucial in guiding the community towards a consensus based on shared values and long-term benefits.'}

Problem 3 : How do you balance the emotional needs of children and the elderly, such as a sense of security, belonging, or entertainment, to ensure that both groups feel valued and included, rather than ignored or marginalized?
Respond : {'function': 'Ne', 'treatment': 'To balance the emotional needs of both children and the elderly, I would propose a multifunctional design for the vacant lot that incorporates elements beneficial to both age groups. For example, creating an intergenerational community space where a playground for children is adjacent to a garden or seating area for the elderly. This design not only provides entertainment for children but also ensures the elderly have a safe and welcoming space to socialize or engage in activities while keeping an eye on the children. Additionally, organizing intergenerational activities or events in this space can foster a sense of community and belonging among both age groups.', 'reason': 'Ne is chosen because it enables the exploration of multiple possibilities and the generation of creative ideas, which is crucial in finding innovative solutions that cater to the diverse emotional needs of both children and the elderly.'}

Problem 4 : How do you demonstrate empathy towards the emotional needs of both parties through language and behavior (such as actively listening or expressing understanding) to promote mutual understanding and willingness to cooperate among residents?
Respond : {'function': 'Fi', 'treatment': "I would start by actively listening to the concerns and desires of both parties, ensuring that I understand not just their words but the underlying emotions and values. For instance, I might say, 'I can see that the idea of a children's playground is not just about a physical space, but about creating a safe and nurturing environment for your children to grow.' Or, 'I understand that a senior citizen activity center is important to you because it represents a space where you can connect with peers and share life experiences.' By acknowledging and validating their emotional needs and personal values, I create a foundation for mutual respect and understanding. This empathetic approach encourages both parties to feel heard and valued, fostering a willingness to cooperate and find a mutually beneficial solution.", 'reason': 'Fi is chosen because it allows for a deep understanding of personal values and emotional judgments, which is essential in demonstrating empathy towards the emotional needs of both parties and promoting mutual understanding and cooperation.'}

Problem 5 : After the meeting, how did you build stronger emotional bonds with the community members to ensure more harmonious community cooperation in the future? Please provide a specific action plan.
Respond : {'function': 'Ni', 'treatment': 'After the meeting, I would initiate a follow-up community event that symbolizes the unity and shared vision we discussed. For example, organizing a community clean-up day for the vacant lot, followed by a gathering where everyone can share their ideas and feelings about the future use of the space. By involving the community in a collective activity and providing a platform for open expression, I can help strengthen emotional bonds and foster a sense of shared purpose.
