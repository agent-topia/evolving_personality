Indiscriminate behavior, while not ideal, at least suggests a form of neutrality or flexibility. However, being indiscriminate (A) is less about being flawed and more about lacking a clear criterion, which resonates with my introspective nature. Thus, I see 'being indiscriminate' as less of a fault in the context of having a clear stance or criterion.
